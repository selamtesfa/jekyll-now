My name is Selam Tesfamariam, and I currently reside in Dallas, Texas. I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia and grew up in Gwinnett county with my parents and 2 younger siblings. I then made my way to Athens, GA where I attended The University of Georgia and received my Bachelors in Business Marketing. Once I graduated in 2016, I began my career with Geico at their Midwest Region in MAcon, Ga. After about a year I then made the decision to move to Dallas, Texas with the same company expanding my experience within the Southern region department.
